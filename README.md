# celeragb
This is the same Celera Genome Browser that was used by several scientific teams during the Celera Genomics share of the completion of the first human genome.
This repository contains that code, and initially it will be at the level it was when first made a freeware project in the mid 2000s.   However, there are some minor exceptions:

* If suitable GFF3 files are provided and configured, those can be used as input data.
* It has been made to compile and build under Java 8, and indeed runs under the latest LTS version, Java 17, by time of writing.
* No attempt was made to export the database backing of the Genome Browser as it would have been time-prohibitive and possibly proprietary to the owning company.

The author of _this_ readme document is humbly submitting the work of over a dozen people over the course of multiple years, and that was just we
developers.  Much of the value of this code--venerable though it is--is derived from the input of the scientific teams who guided its development
through those years.
