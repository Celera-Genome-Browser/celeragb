The genomic data in these directories were produced and released as supplementary
material in support of a paper by Liliana Florea et. al:

Florea L, Di Francesco V, Miller J, Turner R, Yao A, Harris M, Walenz B, Mobarry C,
Merkulov GV, Charlab R, Dew I, Deng Z, Istrail S, Li P, Sutton G. (2005) Gene and
alternative splicing annotation with AIR. Genome Res. 2005 Jan;15(1):54-66.

The data are in the Celera Genome Browser's native file formats (.gbf and .gba), as
well as FASTA format,  and can be viewed by setting the subdirectories as XML
directories in the Edit->Preferences->System->Data Source Settings dialog box.
