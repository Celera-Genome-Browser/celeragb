# This file contains string-to-string mappings for Controlled Vocabulary.
#
# Format:  VOCAB_NAME=key1,val1;key2,val2;key3,val3
#
# The idea is to create GenomicProperty objects specifying a vocabulary name herein
# but the client would display the dereferenced value instead of the key as a form
# of localization. So a BOOLEAN property set as "0" would display as the string "false"
#

BOOLEAN=0,false;1,true
