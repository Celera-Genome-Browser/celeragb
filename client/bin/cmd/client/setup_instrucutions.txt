To setup the .cmd files to work for you, you must at a minimum, define the cel_root
environment variable.  This should point to the base of you checkout area.  You can
define this by adding it to the systems environment, or optionally by creating a 
special file in the repository that sets it for you.  To do the later, create a
file named %USERNAME%.cmd, where %USERNAME% is your system login.  To find
out exactly what it should be, go to a cmd line and type set.  You should find
a USERNAME variable.  This should be turned in to the filename by append .cmd to
whatever it is set to.  Since these files are deconflicted by username, you can check
these files in CVS without any problems.  You can even have different files for home and
work, as long as you use a different login name.

When you run runXXXBrowser.cmd, any parameters that you pass to it will be passed to 
your configuration file.  This allows you to modify your run environment as you would
like.  For example, my .cmd file is shown below.  It first sets cel_root.  It then looks
at the passed parameter.  If nothing is passed, it will not set java_home.  However, if
1.2, 1.2.2 or 1.3 is passed, it will set java_home to different versions of java
accordingly.  The main script uses java_home to find the java executable.  If java_home
is not defined, it will use the first java defined in your system path (the one that 
runs if you do java -version on the command line).

===========================

set var1=%1
set cel_root=e:\develop\jbuilder\genomics\trunk\client-devel

if NOT DEFINED var1 goto end
if %var1%==1.2 set java_home=c:\program files\javasoft\jre\1.2
if %var1%==1.2.2 set java_home=c:\program files\javasoft\jre\1.2
if %var1%==1.3 set java_home=c:\program files\javasoft\jre\1.3
