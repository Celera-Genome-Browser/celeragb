# Celera GB Development Journal
This is to document the origin of the Celera GB

This will not be a thoroughly detailed accounting, since this browser had considerable history over the period discussed.

## Background
Over the course of sometime in early 1999 to 2006, roughly, the Celera Genome Browser was being developed at Celera Genomics and at sister company Applied Biosystems.
Those companies are no longer what they were.  Celera was split off years later, and AB was bought up to eventually become part of Life Sciences Corporation.

However, during that time period, the Celera GB was developed-during-use (for lack of a better term) to help Genomics scientists complete the sequencing and first assembly
of a Human Genome.  This effort was the "private sector" side of the process, which began earlier at NIH.  Eventually, the barriers to cooperation fell away and the two efforts were
joined--for the good of Biological Science.

The code was written in Java and required close cooperation between developers and scientists, who prompted the software team with the requirements often even as they realized
what those requirements were.  It might have been termed an "Agile" effort in many ways, although that term may not have been coined until 2000.  Scientists would work with
the browser, find some limitation (sometimes capacity, sometimes functionality) and ask that it be corrected.  The process went on like that for a considerable period of time.

Eventually, some time after the genome was sequenced, the process changed a bit and the browser was "matured" into what it became as of 2006.

In late 2006, fearing the code would be lost to obscurity, as things were moving along and changing at the parent company, the author of this file worked with one of the former
technical leads to migrate the code into open source.
### Data Sources
The GB originally had both a relational database and an XML-file data source.  It had "promotion"--or move-to-database, of evidence and curated genes.  Things which became
accepted were allowed into the backing database.  However, when taken to open source, the database and server backing were not included.

In 2011, the author added a GFF3 backing to pair with the XML backing.  The GFF3 was not used during the earlier Celera effort.

This form of the Celera GB can still be found at Source Forge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/celeragb/ .

# Technology
The Celera GB's code was nearly all Java except for any XML for ant builds and examples, and a few build scripts in DOS/Win CMD.  That Java was at Java 1.6 as of the 2006 effort.
The build systems was Apache Ant, with some help from DOS CMD files.  Its original backing (as above) was relational, employing at various times Oracle and Sybase.  Its XML
backing was a proprietary "GAME" (Genome Annotation Markup Elements) format.  This format is described here http://xml.coverpages.org/game.html , but the format used by Celera
may have, of necessity, diverged from that.  The relational schema and associated database were developed by teams of developers at Celera and allowed a considerable volume
of information to be accumulated over time.  Source code was stored in the CVS source code control system.

# Other Efforts Since
At least one lab has contacted former developer(s) to adapt the Celera GB for their needs in the years shortly after 2006.

# At SourceForge
Since being deposited at SourceForge in 2006, the Celera GB release there has been downloaded over 1,200 times (at time of writing).  The downloaders have not made known
to what purpose they are using the Celera GB.  However, it is hoped that also housing it at GitHub, with some modernization will help it be of still further use to
the scientific community.
